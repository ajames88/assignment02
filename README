This project is coded in version python2.7.10.

The following command can be entered into the terminal to run this program:

  "./run <letter of the alphabet whose thesaurus to be compared>"

  Example: "./run A"

The purpose of this project is to create a thesaurus using the GNU dictionary
through pairing words with similar significant words in their definitions.
This thesaurus will then be checked for accuracy against the thesaurus parsed
from the Moby Thesaurus.

For purposes of decreasing run-time, this program will only compute a thesaurus
for all the dictionary entries starting the a given letter.

The file 'words.txt' contains a list of entries from the Moby Thesaurus.
The Moby Thesaurus has been placed into the public domain by
'moby-thesarus.org' and the file 'words.txt' was taken from the open source
project associated with 'moby-thesarus.org'. Please reference
'https://github.com/words/moby' for more information.

The following command can be entered into the terminal to run this program:

  "./run <letter of the alphabet whose thesaurus we wish to compare>"

This directory contains python files that have the following functions:

  ParseMobyThesaurus.py: parse thesaurus entries from 'words.txt' and write
  them to 'mobythesarus.txt'.
